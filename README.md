# Classification-of-Kidney-CT-Scans
To perform Classification on Kidney CT images to detect Cyst, Tumor and Stone.

Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nazmul0087/ct-kidney-dataset-normal-cyst-tumor-and-stone

Model(s):  EfficientNetB3 and a simple CNN.

Inferences:

A radiologistâ€™s accuracy of detecting the Kidney Ailments concerned with CT scans alons is 99%. The models presented here can achieve a similar feat with the best model serving an accuracy of 99.7%.

The Averaged Dice Score obtained was 0.99 for the CNN models and 0.97 for the EfficientNet B3 model.

Typically, a clinician requires approx. 5-10 minutes to interpret a Kidney CT scan. The models here can perform the same task within a fraction of a second.

Although the dataset was imbalanced, but due to presence large number of images, the models were trained well. 

Undersampled the dataset to limit a max size of 500, employed the EfficientNet model, the results were the same.

Deemining EfficientNet B3 to be an overkill, trained EfficientNet B0 from scratch. The performance was appalling!!!
